Hi, I'm Evie.
I am a second year physics student at university, but many of my modules are CompSci. 
Currently learning C and C++, and I am already familiar and comfortable with Python, Arduino C, Java, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Looking to start a career in Software Development.
I have finished a course with Code First Girls for WebDev and I am looking for similar opportunities to advance my skills further.
