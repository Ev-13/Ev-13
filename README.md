Hi, I'm Evie.
I am a third year physics student at university, but half of my modules are CompSci. 
Currently working on my Major Project which will be written in Python using packages such as Scikit Learn, and I am already familiar and comfortable with Python, Arduino C, Java, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Looking to start a career in Data Science / Analytics.

I have finished a course with Code First Girls for WebDev and I am looking for similar opportunities to advance my skills further.
